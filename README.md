# Turkish-Latin-to-Cyrillic
A tab separated text file for use in converting **Turkish** in **Latin** script to **Turkish** in **Cyrillic** script.

The table makes use of [**Perl Compatible Regular Expressions**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl_Compatible_Regular_Expressions) (**PCRE**) so that it can be used with (e.g.) [**DataMystic TextPipe**](https://datamystic.com/textpipe).

**Turkish** in **Cyrillic** script is used within the Turkish community living in **Bulgaria**.

The tab separated file is called by the simple **TextPipe** filter that is now also provided.

NB. The **Clipboard copy of the filter** is merely to aid human comprehension of the design.
