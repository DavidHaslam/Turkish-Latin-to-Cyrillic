# Turkish-Latin-to-Cyrillic
A tab separated text file for use in converting **Turkish** in **Latin** script to **Turkish** in **Cyrillic** script.

The table makes use of **Perl Compatible Regular Expressions** (**PCRE**) so that it can be used with (e.g.) **DataMystic TextPipe**.

**Turkish** in **Cyrillic** script is used within the Turkish community living in **Bulgaria**.

The tab separated file is called by the simple **TextPipe** filter that is now also provided.

NB. The **Clipboard copy of the filter** is merely to aid human comprehension of the design.
